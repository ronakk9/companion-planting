Use of unsupervised learning to form clusters of crops that can be grown together. Also suggest the proportion of NPK in a fertilizer input.


By initial data exploration, plants which require high N,P,K, humidity and rainfall were realised.

N - 
rice
maize
banana
watermelon
muskmelon
cotton
jute 
coffee

P - 
chickpea
kidneybeans
pigeonpeas
blackgram
lentil
banana
grapes
apple

K -
chickpea
grapes
apple

humidity - 
rice
mungbean
pomegranate
banana
grapes
watermelon
muskmelon
apple 
orange
papaya
coconut
cotton
jute

rainfall -
rice
pigeonpeas
papaya
coconut
jute 
coffee

After doing Kmeans Clustering - we get four clusters (please refer code)
Out of these 4 clusters, 3 clusters have crops which can be grown together (based on the above data- please check the pdf file)

Had a lot of fun doing this project! Please let me know if you have any feedback.
Thanks!
